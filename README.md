Code for the working paper "A bridge between information theory, saddlepoint approximations,
and measure transportation" by Andrej Ilievski, Davide La Vecchia, Elvezio Ronchetti.

The folder contains the R code for the saddlepoint density approximation (Sad) and the Edgeworth expansion (Edg) of the 
mean of n iid random variable, exponentially distributed. In both codes the Monte Carlo siuze is MCsize = 5000.

The code Sadd_Exp.R generates the Figure 2 and Figure 3 available in the paper.

The code Test_Level_Power.R generates the Figure 4 available in the paper, for n=10. The other curves are obtained changing n.
