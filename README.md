Code for the working paper "A bridge between information theory, saddlepoint approximations,
and measure transportation" by Andrej Ilievski, Davide La Vecchia, Elvezio Ronchetti.

The file contains the R code for the saddlepoint density approximation (Sad) and the Edgeworth expanion (Edg) of the 
mean of n iid random variable, exponentially distributed with rate 1. The code generates Figure 2 available in the paper.
